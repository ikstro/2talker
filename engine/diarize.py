"""Who spoke when: pyannote's community-1 pipeline.

Hugging Face asks for a free token once, to download it; after that the
pipeline is loaded from MODELS_DIR/diarization and works offline. A token is
checked as soon as it is saved (`Setup`), and the model downloaded there and
then, so the window can say at once whether speakers will work.
