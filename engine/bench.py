"""How fast each model runs on this computer.

A short test (`Calibrator`, run when the person agrees in Krya) measures every
model already downloaded on a bundled clip: a 7 s phrase as Dictate recognizes it,
and 30 s as Transcribe does. Real use keeps the numbers up afterwards: every
transcription's words and speakers, every dictated phrase. Krya reads them from
/health (`bench`) and chooses the models from them (src/speechplan.ts).

Kept in speech.json as {fingerprint, at, runs: {"model|device|compute": {phrase, rtf, n, at, source}}}.
The fingerprint is this computer's (processor, memory, cards, driver), as Krya
sends it with the plan: on another computer the numbers start again.
