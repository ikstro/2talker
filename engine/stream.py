"""A dictation heard while it is spoken.

The badge sends the microphone as it records: raw 16-bit PCM at 16 kHz, a
quarter of a second at a time. The session keeps it all and, every half
second, looks with the VAD (Silero, inside faster-whisper) at what is not yet
recognized: a stretch of speech followed by a pause of 0.6 s or more is a piece
of its own, and one thread recognizes the pieces in order while the person
goes on talking. When the key is let go, only the tail is left to recognize;
and when the person stopped a moment before letting go (the usual case), the
tail was recognized already, as a guess made in that pause.

Whisper pays a full 30 s window for any piece, so its pieces are long (4 s or
more on the processor, 10 s on the card); Parakeet costs what the sound lasts,
so its pieces may be short. Whisper's language is found once, on the first
piece, among the expected ones (the person's own, English), and kept; each
piece is told the text before it, so it goes on in its style.

Nothing is kept: the sound lives in memory until the session is over.
