"""Words the person wants spelled right: surnames, product names, their own terms.

The vocabulary is a list of {word, heard}: `word` is the spelling, `heard` what
the recognizer writes instead ("альтайп", "all type" for Altype). Whisper is
told the spellings beforehand (`hotwords`), and whatever it still writes its
own way is put right afterwards (`correct`, `correct_segments`): first what it
was heard as, then the spelling in another case, then, for a long word, a near
miss of one or two letters. Only words are touched; the text between them
(spaces, punctuation) stays as it was.

Parakeet takes no hotwords, so for it the correction is all there is.
